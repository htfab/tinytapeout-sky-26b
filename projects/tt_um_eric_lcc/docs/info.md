## How it works

![overview](lcc_ds_draft_1.png)

This chip is the core for a complete system for a
capacitive discharge model rocket launch controllers. It provides
capacitor charging, igniter continuity testing, current controlled
igniter drive, and safety capacitor energy dump. It provides a
control and status interface suitable for either digital or direct front
panel and speaker connections. The chip implements
complete system control from power on, charging, continuity, launch, and
dump of capacitor energy.
The algorithms control the systems power stage via
digital pwm outputs based on ADC serial input feedback.
There are 3 pwm outputs to control: 1amp capacitor charger, a 2-
8amp igniter output, and a 25watt resistor capacitor energy dump.
The capacitor charger generates a pwm output for a flybackconverter
with optimized for 1amp battery operation and while
charging to 320V.
The ignition driver generates a pwm output for a buck-converter
that delivers constant current control over the full capacitor
discharge voltage range. The igniter current pulse profile begins
with steps from 2 amps to 8 amps suitable for 0.5ohm consumer
and 2ohm profession igniters and matches. The full energy of the
capacitor is used with a timeout and burn-through detection for
robustness.
The energy dump drives an external discharge circuit to dump any
remaining capacitor charge into a load power resistor upon
completion.

## How to test

For simulation test an integer system model and dADC model are added in the tb.v so that the feedback
is provided and a system level test is performed. The test is truncated as much as possible (ie cap precharged and early exit after burnthrough) and still takes about 400sec for the (icarsu) simualtion to complete (150ms). I have not tested with gate level sims yet.

For electrical testing I use am FPGA board with the same system and ADC models incorporated, and run a full test. The FPGA also has a full capture of the entire operation into hyperram and includes HDMI display of the operation with controls for pan/zoom to allow validation of correct operation.

## External hardware

![overview](lcc_ds_draft_2.png)

List external hardware used:
	- 3 channels of 12 bit ADC simultaneous sampleing at 3Mhz
	- PWM controlled flyback transformer with FET and driver to charge a capacitor
	- PWM controlled output FET with flaoting driver and output inductdor
	- PWM controlled dump FET with driver and dump resistor.
	- speaker with transistor driver
	- Launch and mute button inputs to GND, with pullup resistors
	- Arm and continuity LEDs active high outputs.
	- and of course an output load in the range of 0 to 100 ohms (typ 0.5 to 2 ohm)
